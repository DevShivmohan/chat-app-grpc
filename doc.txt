Java Spring Boot Grpc - an exhaustive example

 * stream - if connection closed, does onError() called ??

 * if onNext() called fast after onCompleted() - can onCompleted() be called before big onNext() finished to process?

 lifecycle of the stream


 concurrent calls to onNext():
                            - happens-before ?
                            - shared resources ?
                            - same OR different threads ?
                            - context ?
